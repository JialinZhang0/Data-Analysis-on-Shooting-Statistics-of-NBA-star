## Project description

In this project, we wanted to find Stephen Curry's 3 best shooting positions using his 2017 season data. We first plot the coordinate's of each of his shots
then use kmeans clustering to localize regions where he takes shots. Using this, we were able to find his best shooting positions. We then made a Gaussian
Mixture Model with the clustering data.

In the second portion, we analyze Stephen Curry's Playoff Data with his
seasonal data to see whether or not he performs better or worse during the
Playoffs.
